1. To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation

2. Big O Notation can gives us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of
an algorithm

3. Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)

4. The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used
to run the algorithm

5. Big O Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice!
